Protractor is a [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) program built on top of [WebDriverJS](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/WebDriverJs). Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would.\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nProtractor 4 is compatible with nodejs v4 and newer. If you absolutely need to use nodjs at 0.12, use Protractor@2.\n\nProtractor work with Angular versions greater than 1.0.6/1.1.4, and is compatible with Angular 2 applications. Note that for Angular 2 apps, the `binding` and `model` locators are not supported. We recommend using `by.css`.\n\n\nGetting Started\n---------------\n\nThe Protractor documentation for users is located in the [protractor/docs](https://github.com/angular/protractor/tree/master/docs) folder.\n\nTo get set up and running quickly:\n - The [Protractor Website](http://angular.github.io/protractor)\n - Work through the [Tutorial](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/tutorial)\n - Take a look at the [Table of Contents](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/toc)\n\nOnce you are familiar with the tutorial, you’re ready to move on. To modify your environment, see the Protractor Setup docs. To start writing tests, see the Protractor Tests docs.\n\nTo better understand how Protractor works with the Selenium WebDriver and Selenium Server see the reference materials.\n\n\nGetting Help\n------------\n\nCheck the [Protractor FAQ](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/docs/faq.md) and read through the [Top 20 questions on StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/protractor?sort=votes&pageSize=20).\n\nPlease ask usage and debugging questions on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/protractor) (use the [\"protractor\"](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask?tags=protractor) tag), the [Gitter](https://gitter.im/angular/protractor) chat room, or in the [Angular discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/angular). (Please do not ask support questions here on Github.)\n\n\nFor Contributors\n----------------\nClone the github repository:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/angular/protractor.git\n    cd protractor\n    npm install\n    ./bin/webdriver-manager update\n    cd website\n    npm install\n    cd ..\n\nStart up a selenium server. By default, the tests expect the selenium server to be running at `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`. A selenium server can be started with [webdriver-manager](https://github.com/angular/webdriver-manager) which is included in\n[bin/webdriver-manager](https://github.com/angular/protractor/blob/master/bin/webdriver-manager).\n\n    webdriver-manager update\n    webdriver-manager start\n\nProtractor's test suite runs against the included test application.\n\nInstall the test application dependencies with:\n\n    npm run install_testapp\n\nStart that up with\n\n    npm start\n\nThen run the tests with\n\n    npm test\n",
